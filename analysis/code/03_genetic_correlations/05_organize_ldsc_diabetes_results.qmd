title: "Organizing ldsc results for genetic correlations of FMD with UKB diabetes traits"
format: gfm
---


First, we read in the text file that contains the results for 30 genetic correlations. Recall that 
I created this text file by parsing the output of `ldsc`. 
I'll read the file into an R session and give the tibble the appropriate column names.


```{r}
results_file <- here::here("analysis", "results", "ldsc_genetic_correlations_diabetes_fmd.txt")
cnames <- c("phenotype1", 
            "phenotype2", 
            "rg", 
            "se", 
            "z", 
            "p", 
            "h2_obs",
            "h2_obs_se",
            "h2_int",
            "h2_int_se",  "gcov_int",  "gcov_int_se"
            )
results_file |>
    vroom::vroom(col_names = cnames) |>
    
```
