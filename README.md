The goal of this project is to perform 2-sample MR studies to identify possible consequences of FMD. 
We'll use summary statistics from GWAS. Min-Lee Yang previously shared, via email, the path 
to the meta-analysis FMD GWAS summary statistics. 

The Neale Lab has shared their GWAS summary statistics from their UK Biobank analyses.

I want to perform a 2-sample MR to assess the causal effect of FMD on creatinine. Once I do that, 
I will expand the analysis to other kidney function-related traits, such as Cystatin C.
